							<h2>#6 PilarNG, frontend-angular framework !</h2>
							<span>May, 2021</span>
							<p>Hi guys, I am not really sure if I can tell you about this, but I am really excited about it so maybe this is just a little sneak peak.
							</p>
							<p>PilarNG is a frontend framework that is used in BSI UII to develop gateway.uii.ac.id.
								This framework is AngularJS based, I contributed once when I worked there and it was really challenging for me.
								What I know, it was created to increase the website performance of gateway.uii.ac.id without using many resources from unused components or library. As you know,
								bootstrap angular framework (ngx-bootstrap) has many components and I am pretty sure we don't use it all. So, PilarNg is exist to support the development of gateway.uii.ac.id and I am pretty sure
								that this framework will become popular if it is developed constantly.</p>
							<p>	If you are curious, here is <a href="https://pilar-ng.web.app/" target="_blank">PilarNG</a>!</p>

							<h2>#4 Materializecss vs Bootstrap, which one I prefer ?</h2>
							<span>April, 2021</span>
							<p>Please don't waste your time by questioning "which is the best front-end framework ?", because both of these framework have different styles.
							</p>
							<div class="img-container">
								<img src="img/blog/Bootstrap-vs-Materialize.png" class="img-responsive" alt="bootstrap-vs-materialize">
							</div>
							<p>Bootstrap was a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites. And nowadays, it is the world’s most popular framework and everyone will be familiar with this framework because many templates are using it.
								There are many components are available, so it will really help every website developer. Bootstrap has it own style for a responsive website which is different from material UI design.
							</p>

							<p>Materializecss is a modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design, the component has the similarity to mobile application interaction.
								It is really simple to use and you can make a mobile app interface easily with this framework.
								</p>
							
							<p>So, what I prefer is it depends on what kind of UI that I have to code. If it is material UI design or a hybrid web-mobile app, I prefer materializecss.
								But if the website design is more complex, I would prefer bootstrap since it has many blueprints on internet. You may check
								<a href="https://bootsnipp.com/" target="_blank">Bootsnipp</a> to find many blueprints of Bootstrap.

							<h2>#3 Make your own Font Icon set!</h2>
							<span>March, 2021</span>
							<p>Oh hi! I am gonna make this short writing because I am too excited to tell you that you can make your own Font Icon sets.
								If you are a front-end engineer you have to consider about the website performance and quality, one of them is not using many images in a website.
								Warning! do not use image to load the icons because it is not good for responsive website and it takes more page load time.
								You better use <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons" target="_blank">Google font</a>  or <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">Font awesome</a>,
								but if you want to have your own Font Icon, <a href="https://icomoon.io/" target="_blank">Icomoon.io</a> is one of the solution.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Go to <a href="https://icomoon.io/" target="_blank">Icomoon.io</a> and click Icomoon app </li>
								<li>Import your icon with svg format or you can click Add icons from Library</li>
								<li>Select the icon that you want to generate</li>
								<li>You can setup the prefix, CSS selector and font name if you want by clicking Preferences button</li>
								<li>Click Generate Font</li>

							<h2>#2 From Web-designer to Web-Developer</h2>
							<span>February, 2021</span>
							<p>FYI! I am a website designer at the first, all I know is just designing a website based on the business process and requirements by using a wireframe and photoshop. When I know how to code a website using html, css and javascript,
								I encouraged myself to became a website designer. I used to design the UI before I code and in some projects I also make the UX,
								I feel comfortable if I develop a website from zero, so I use template rarely.
							</p>
							<p>I decided to become a website developer as a front-end engineer after 3 years experience in front-end developer. At first, I didn't know the difference between Front-end developer and Front-end engineer but here it is :</p>
							<p class="blockquotes"><span class="f-weight">Frontend developer</span> just implements the GUI, using the provided design, specification and consultations with colleagues/client for additional information.
								<span class="f-weight">Frontend engineer</span> first measures the client and all the monitors by using a Vernier caliper, calculates their mass, acceleration and other parameters</p>
							<p>So, for you who is curious to know about website development feel free to learn and ask. Basically I am not a programmer, I am just a person who loves to design and curious about programming and here I am, fighting!
							</p>

							<h2>#1 How can I become a programmer ?</h2>
							<span>January, 2021</span>
							<p>Hi, this is me Virah and welcome to my personal website. In this first blog section, I am gonna tell you about how can I become a programmer.
								Well, it's all started since I really love to play game and curious about everything about computer. Short story, I learnt about game program and
								it was not successful, so I decided to know more about being a programmer. By that learning, I knew that there are some program languages in different kind,
								then I decided to become a website programmer. I didn't know much until I got in IT faculty of university, in my fifth semester I did some freelance projects and joined a company as a web developer.
								Graduated on 2017, I dove myself into website developer and became a front-end engineer after some experiences.
							</p>
							<p>That's all I can tell, I wish you a happiness in life and thanks for coming to my blog.</p>
